# data_vis_w_laptops
This is a data visualization project, where I create plots and try to pull some information from the data using R!

If you decide to download the code, remember to change the working directory to fit your system.
The data is the same one used in my Scikit-Learn Machine Learning project on Python. If you have it, you can use that data or just download the one here.
